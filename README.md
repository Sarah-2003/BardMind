*Shakespeare teaching - A glimpse into classical literature meets modern AI*

## 📚 About the Project
BardMind is an innovative implementation of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model specifically designed for Shakespearean text generation. Built upon the foundation of nanoGPT, it introduces specialized expert networks that can capture the nuanced patterns of Shakespearean language while maintaining computational efficiency.

## 🎯 Why This Project
Traditional language models often struggle with the unique characteristics of Shakespearean English:
* Complex vocabulary and meter patterns
* Archaic grammar structures
* Unique rhetorical devices
* Context-dependent word usage

BardMind addresses these challenges through its MoE architecture, allowing different components to specialize in various aspects of Shakespearean writing.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch numpy transformers datasets tiktoken wandb tqdm
```

### Training Pipeline
1. **Prepare Dataset**
```bash
python data/shakespeare_char/prepare.py
```

2. **Train Model**
```bash
python train.py config/train_shakespeare_moe.py --device=cpu --compile=False
```

3. **Generate Text**
```bash
python sample.py --out_dir=out-shakespeare-moe --device=cpu
```

### MoE Specific Settings
```python
num_experts = 4
top_k = 2
expert_capacity_factor = 1.25
